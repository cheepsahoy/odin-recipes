    <p>Some dishes are greater than the sum of their parts. Spaghetti aglio olio is a simple dish, its flavor comes from basically four things: garlic, parmesan, lemon juice, and olive oil. There's a little heat, but its not the star of the show. This is a savory, nutty, salty, and flavorful dish - but it is also incredibly light! I love eating this on a lazy day because the flavor really brightens my mood. I hope you enjoy it </p>
    <p> You will need: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>300g of spaghetti</li>
        <li>One whole clove of garlic</li>
        <li>One lemon</li>
        <li>Sprig of italian parsley</li>
        <li>1 cup Freshly grated parmesan reggiano</li>
        <li>Black pepper</li>
        <li>Cayenne / Spicy pepper</li>
        <li>Red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>MSG</li>
        <li>Salt</li>

    </ul>
    <p><em>Buckle up! Its About to get Wild!</em></p>
    <h2>Lets get cookin!</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start a pot of water and get it well salted. Bring it to a boil and add the spaghetti.</li>
        <li>While the spaghetti cooks, dice a whole clove of garlic, place it in a sauce pan top the mixture off with olive oil to lightly cover the garlic if there isn't enough fat </li>
        <li>When the garlic shimmers (2-3 minutes), wait until it softens and begins to stick to a wooden spoon. Then, take it off the heat and 1-2TBsps of red pepper flakes (depending on your spice tolerance)</li>
        <li>Drain the pasta, saving a cup of pasta water for emulsion later. Then, readd the pasta to the pot.</li>
        <li>Add the oil / red pepper / garlic mixture to the pot, stir again. </li>
        <li>Add freshly chopped parsley - add more than you think you need!</li>
        <li>Juice half a lemon into the pasta</li>
        <li>Add parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>Taste! I reccomend hitting it with some cayenne to increase the heat, and some MSG / Salt to taste</li>
        <li>Plate, sprinkle with more parmesan</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Enjoy!</p>
