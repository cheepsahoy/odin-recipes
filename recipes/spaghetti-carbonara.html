        <p>Spaghetti carbonara is what happens if you ever thought: why does breakfast have to suck? Why cant it be a pasta dish? Well suck no more breakfast, enjoy this delicious dish that combines all the flavors of breakfast with all the carbs of pasta.</p>
        <p> You will need: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>300g of spaghetti</li>
            <li>50g of Pancetta or a Diced Bacon</li>
            <li>3 Eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup Freshly grated parmesan reggiano</li>
            <li>Black pepper</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>MSG</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>Buckle up! Its About to get Wild!</em></p>
        <h2>Lets get cookin!</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by rendering the pancetta or the diced bacon in a large sauce pan over medium-low heat. We are looking for a couple steps away from crisp, but not chewy. We wanna get the fat off the pork. When finished cooking, take off the heat - its ok for it to be warm, not hot </li>
            <li> Crack 1 egg into a bowl. Then seperate the yolks from 2 other eggs, adding them to the same bowl. Whisk the mixture. Add parmesan reggiano until the its a goopy paste. Then add a lot of fresh cracked pepper into the mixture - it should look speckled!</li>
            <li>Start a pot of water and get it well salted. Bring it to a boil and add the spaghetti.</li>
            <li>Drain the pasta, saving a cup of pasta water for emulsion later. Then, readd the pasta to the sauce pan. Mix the pancetta in. Quickly pour the yolk/cheese mixture made early into the pot and stir constantly. The heat of the pasta will cook the mixture into a creamy sauce. If the sauce isn't slick enough, consider adding some of the reserved pasta water a little at a time.</li>
            <li>Taste! I reccomend hitting it with some MSG / Salt to taste</li>
            <li>Plate, sprinkle with more parmesan</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Enjoy!</p>
